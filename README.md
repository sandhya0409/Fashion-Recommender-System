# Fashion-Recommender-System

1)This project is going to use Deep learning ,CNN
2)Transferring learning --->ResNET--->imageNET(This RESNET model is already developed by computer scientist.)


Overall approach /plan of attack
1)Import model.
2)extract Features.
3)export Features.
4)Generate recommendations (nearest neighbours using scikit learn library)


Note on Model Files: The .pkl file for the trained model isn't available due to GitHub size limits. You can recreate the model using the provided code in app.py, which includes all necessary steps for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

Dataset Information: This project uses a dataset of over 50,000 fashion images from (Kaggle). It is organized for model training, validation, and testing, covering various fashion categories and attributes.
